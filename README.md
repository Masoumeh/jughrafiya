Arabic and Persian Geographical MD Texts: This is a repository of texts freely available in online collections. Here the texts are pre-processed using our markdown scheme for the later conversion to TEI XML, followed by integration into the Perseus Digital Library

The following is the list of geographical texts (more detailed list in the Google Doc). Unprocessed texts are in the subfolder "Unprocessed" (with URIs as filenames). If you start working on a text, create a new copy in the folder "Processing". When you are done, move it to "Processed." Processed texts must have their structure tagged according to Arabic MD scheme, which is described in the Google Doc. As you work, please, add comments to relevant texts.

## Sources
A very significant number of sources is available in electronic format; codes in parenthesis denote IDs of books in several different libraries, some of which have electronic texts (Alwaraq,\* NoorLib,\* JK, Shamela, Shia—texts from the last three are already available as text files) and/or book scans, either browsable or as downloadable PDFs (Waqfeya, NoorLib, and, occasionally, Hathi). The goal is to tag geographical information in these sources using our own markdown scheme and then reformat these data into re-usable formats that can be employed in modeling geospatial relations of different kind. For those texts that have no electronic versions to tag, we can re-type relevant information using the same markdown scheme. Working on electronically unavailable texts should be postponed until after all available text are processed.

\*Alwaraq (http://www.alwaraq.net/) has complete electronic texts, but they are not based on any editions (i.e., there are no references to specific editions, nor preserved pagination); NoorLib (http://www.noorlib.ir/) has electronic text for most of the titles that it includes. Scraping is possible for Alwaraq, but very complicated for NoorLib (in this case texts can be saved manually page by page, which is not difficult if texts are short).

Books for which I do not have texts can still be found online (author+title (in Arabic)+download/تحميل in Google search usually give some decent results).

Note on texts: all texts require collation with the editions on which they are based; PDFs of scanned texts can be found on Waqfeya (http://www.waqfeya.com/) and https://archive.org/ (or, simply through Google search); the entire BGA is available on Archive.org (I have it and can share, but I am not sure if you guys have enough space in your DropBoxes)
